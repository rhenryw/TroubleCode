This is a little GZIP code for transmitting info over email/IM. So I can view the user's deployment issues without 800 screenshots.

The JS that generates the code is mine but the UI for displaying it is AI because I am the only person that will use this

Why I created this
---

Because people kept DMing me that https://splash.best isn't working for them and I don't want to have them send me a bunch of screenshots and then not have console available. 

This fixes that
